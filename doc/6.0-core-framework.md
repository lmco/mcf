# MBEE Core Framework

## Test

### Test Framework Overview

Tests will be executed in numeric order. To do this effectively, the following
naming conventions are used to number tests:

All tests will begin with a three digit number. The first two digits denote its
category

- **0xx:** Reserved for initialization tasks. These should be used for any
  database initialization or other tasks to be done before all tests.
- **1xx:** Tests the test framework and basic infrastructure. These
  should be used to identify basic configuration issues like Mocha or Chai or
  to identify simple errors such as a missing files.
- **2xx:** These should be used for unit tests of libraries and helpers. It can
  also be used for other basic tests that have few or no dependencies.
- **3xx:** These should be used for unit tests of data models.
- **4xx:** These should be used for controller tests.
- **5xx:** These should be used to test the API via mock requests.
- **6xx:** These should be used for API tests while running the MBEE server.
- **7xx:** These should be used for UI tests while running the MBEE server.
- **8xx:** These should be used for integration and system level tests.
- **9xx:** Reserved for wrap-up tasks to be used in conjunction
  with *0xx* initialization tasks.

All tests will begin with a three digit number. The full name of the test,
seen by Mocha, should correspond to the name of the file.

> **How it works:** Mocha tests are a collection of `it` functions wrapped in
> a `describe` function. The first parameter passed to the describe function is
> the test name. We dynamically grab the file name of the current file and pass
> that into the describe function. This ensures that the test name as seen by
> Mocha corresponds to the file name containing the test.

These test numbers are used both to uniquely identify the tests and to define
their order of execution.

### Code Conventions and ESLint

While this isn't strictly a testing topic, it is a good practice that relates to
testing as it helps avoid inconsistencies or problems in the code base. We use
ESLint to maintain certain standards and conventions in our code.

You can start by simply running the linter by running `node mbee lint`. The
rule set for ESLint is defined in the [.eslintrc](.eslintrc) file and aligns with
our style guide.

We also recommend using EditorConfig. The [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) file
in the project's root directory will help enforce some of those style conventions.

### Running Tests

Tests can be run by running the `node mbee test` command. Alternatively, this
can be done by running `node scripts/test`, `yarn run test`, or `npm test`.
Ultimately, this maps to a shell command that runs `mocha` and passes any
command line arguments to Mocha.

To run specific tests, you can pass in a regular expression via Mocha's `--grep`
flag. This regex will run only tests starting with that name. For example:

```
node mbee test --grep "^[0-4]"   # Runs tests 000 - 499
node mbee test --grep "^301"     # Runs test 301
node mbee test --grep "^6[0-2]"  # Runs tests 600-629
```

Any other Mocha arguments are valid to pass to the test command.

### Writing Tests

Tests are written in the form of a *test module* which contains a collection
of tests. The test module must contain a single top-level `describe` function
(see [Mocha's Documentation](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started) for more
detail).

Each test module name should begin with a three-digit number which uniquely
identifies the test and determines the order in which it runs. That module
should be stored in the appropriately numbered directory within the test
directory.

Here are some guidelines for writing unit tests:

1. **Start with expected behavior.** Does the code do what it's supposed to do
when given valid input? Include a few test cases. For example: for a *User*
model. Make sure to add a user, delete a user, modify users, etc.
2. **Hit corner cases.** If there is unusual or unexpected input, make sure to
test it. For example: What if a user has a really long user name or email?
3. **Test invalid input.** Make sure it properly handles invalid input as you
would expect it to. For example: What if you try to add a user with an invalid
name or email? Or, what if you try to add a user that already exists?
4. **Leave the system in the state it started in.** Make sure the test suite
leaves the system in the same state it started in. For example if you added a
project, delete it. This allows unit tests to be written without knowledge of
other test suites or the order of test execution.

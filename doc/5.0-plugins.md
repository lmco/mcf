# Plugins

An alternative to writing integrations that interface with MBEE via the REST 
API, the MBEE Core Framework (MCF) supports plugins. Plugins are server-side 
extension of the MCF that allow integrations to add new API endpoints, create
additional views, and directly interface with MBEE data using the modules built
in to the the core framework.

Because plugins are server-side and execute code on the MBEE server, they 
introduce additional security risks that must be carefully evaluated before 
running any plugin. As extensions of the Core Framework, plugins can introduce
any vulnerability that could exist in the core framework such as cross-site
scripting, authentication bypass, data exposure, and more. It is critical that 
these risks be mitigated by vetting plugins with the same care and scrutiny that
is used to vet the core framework.

As server-side extensions of the Core Framework, plugins must also be written in
Node.js. The only interface required of a plugin is that the plugin's main file 
(i.e. the file described by the *main* field in the plugin's package.json file)
must export an Express.js application.


## Tutorial: Hello World

This section shows the creating of a simple plugin for MBEE that adds a single
route that returns the string "Hello World."

First, run `npm init` and enter the information for your plugin.

```python
const express = require('express');                   // Require express
const app = express();                                // Create an express app
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello world!')); // Define a route
module.exports = app;                                 // Export the app
```

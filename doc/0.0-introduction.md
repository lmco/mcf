# Introduction

Welcome to the MBEE Flight Manual. This document is intended to be an all 
encompassing user manual for the Model-Based Engineering Environment (MBEE). 
The document begins with introductory material describing what MBEE is, what it
does, and how it can be used to establish a collaborative, well-integrated 
modeling environment for multidisciplinary engineering organizations.

Section one of this manual provides a brief introduction to getting started with
MBEE. This covers a brief overview of MBEE that outlines the general concepts of
MBEE and its architecture. Following this, section 1 provides details on 
installing and running MBEE. Finally, this section goes over MBEE basics to get
started working with MBEE.

The second section of this document provides detailed information on using MBEE.
This section is structured to provide a general and multidisciplinary approach
to the use of MBEE.

As MBEE is first and foremost a modeling tool, section three extends the 
"Using MBEE" content in a format that provides a focus specific to system 
modeling.

Section 4 discusses integrations and details the various ways data can be 
integrated and exchanged with MBEE. This section covers the MBEE API in detail
and provides a tutorial on building an API-based integration for MBEE. This 
API-based approach allows service-based integrations to be used to grow the
environment in a horizontal and distributed architecture.

While plugins are a type of integration, they are fundamentally different from 
API-based integrations with respect to their overall architecture, their 
capabilities, and their impact on the MBEE security posture. Due to the unique 
nature of plugins, they are given their own section in this document - 
Section 5. Plugins are a server-side mechanism for integrating data and new 
capabilities into MBEE that differs from the API-based approach. Plugins grow 
monolithic core of the environment to extend the capability of MBEE.

The inner workings of the MBEE Core Framework (MCF) are discussed in Section 6. 
This section is written for those who want to modify the core framework itself. 
This may be done for a variety of reasons including adding a new authentication 
module, modifying views or routes, extending data models, and much more. MCF 
was built to be open source and was designed with this degree of extensibility 
in mind. 

## About MBEE

The Model-Based Engineering Environment (MBEE) is modeling collaboration tool
that integrates system models with multidisciplinary engineering data to enable
the system model to be a single-source of truth for project data. It makes model
data more accessible via a web-based user interface (UI) for ease of use across
disciplines and skill sets within an organization. This web-based interface
provides a mechanism for team members to interact with system model data without 
needing to be a systems modeler themselves.
                                               
The goal of MBEE is to better communicate data across engineering organizations
by implementing the core goals of model-based systems engineering through
software tools. MBEE decreases ambiguity by making the concept of single-source 
of truth more achievable through its RESTful API, extensible plugins, and
distributed services.

The core component of MBEE is the **MBEE Core Framework (MCF)**. This framework 
implements the core capabilities of MBEE such as model management, RESTful API
endpoints, plugin management, UI framework and more. This monolithic core 
provides a centralized ecosystem for connecting distributed microservices that 
are used to share inter-model data.

**Plugins** can be used to extend the capabilties of the MCF by adding new API
endpoints, creating new views and UI components, and developing new ways of 
interacting with model data. This concept is key to the MBEE's core design 
objective of providing a platform that can be domain-generic and easily 
extensible.

**Services**, **microservices**, **desktop clients**, and other **API-based 
integrations** can be used outside of the core MBEE framework to connect
external systems and multidisciplinary models to exchange and integrate data.

This approach allows distributed services to be used to interact with external 
systems and integrate data from external models into MBEE. These services can
be cloud-based microservices, monolithic enterprise services, desktop clients,
or any number of other clients that can access a RESTful HTTP API.

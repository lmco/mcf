# Using MBEE

MBEE provides a platform for modeling that can be accessed through a range of
tools that interface with MBEE's RESTful API. In addition to these external 
tools, MBEE provides a web-based UI for interacting with models. This section
of the MBEE Flight Manual focuses on using MBEE and provides an introduction
to the web interface.

To learn more about interfacing with MBEE from a SysML desktop client, see
Section 3, which details

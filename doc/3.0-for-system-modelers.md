# For System Modelers

Integrating system models into MBEE is currently in work and, like the UI,
still rapidly changing. This section will briefly detail the current approach
of integrating system models with MBEE.

## Connecting the Model

<!-- START LMPI -->

An API-based integration service has been developed which provides one-way
synchronization from Teamwork Cloud (TWC) to MBEE. This service is currently in 
beta. If you have a model in Teamwork Cloud that you would like to connect to 
MBEE, please contact the MBEE development team for assistance.

Why one-way sync? This service only provides one-way synchronization because of
limitations of the Teamwork Cloud API. Our team is currently testing the ability
to update models in TWC via the TWC API, but we were advised by NoMagic to avoid
modifying model contents in TWC via the API because it will corrupt the model.

## Uses

<!-- START LMPI -->

Despite the current limitations of model synchronization, there are a number of
use cases that we've found useful.

**Model Query** 
There are few ways to do this. First, the API can be used
to obtain model elements using a programming language of your choice. The MBEE
team has used high-level languages like JavaScript and Python to easily query 
the model and execute more sophisticated filtering operations to analyze model 
patterns or filter on specific types of elements. More advanced query 
capabilities will be added to MBEE in version 0.8.0.

The MBEE development team has also developed examples of using the MBEE API to 
connect MBEE models (and subsets of models) to Neo4j, a graph database. This
allows the model to be easily queried using the Cypher query language which 
provides a simple syntax for analyzing model/graph relationships.

In the case of modeling the MBEE software itself, we have used this capability
to analyze interactions and dependencies of code modules and to analyze failure
modes.

**Document Generation**
Model data can be easily retrieved and filtered via the MBEE API. This can
then be used to generate systems engineering documents based on model contents.

Early prototypes have been developed that show this can be used to generate 
Word, Excel, or PDF documents.

**Requirements Traceability**

Combining model query with document generation allows for easy generation of
specific types of documents that are derived from specific relationships in 
the model. One such example of this is requirements traceability.

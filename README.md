The Model-Based Engineering Environment (MBEE) is a modeling collaboration software
that integrates system models with multidisciplinary engineering data and tools.
This enables system models to be a single-source of truth. MBEE allows for model
data to be more accessible across disciplines and skill sets via web-based UI.
The UI enables users to interact with system model data without needing to be a
systems modeler.

MBEE's mission is to better communicate data across engineering organizations
by implementing the core goals of model-based systems engineering through
software tools. MBEE decreases ambiguity by making a single-source of truth for
data more achievable through its RESTful API, extensible plugins, and
distributed services.

## Prerequisites

#### Node.js
MBEE's first dependency to get started is Node.js and NPM. NPM comes with
Node.js; just install packages with NPM to get started. To start up MBEE,
node version 10.15.0 or greater is required.
See [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) for information on Node.js.

#### Redis
Redis is used as the session manager. It stores the cookie and auth tokens
for integration services.

#### Database
You will also need an instance of a document based database. MongoDB is the
preferred database, but MBEE does support plug-n-play with different databases,
as long as a database strategy has been defined. To view more information on the
database abstraction layer and how to configure existing strategies, please
visit [the README in app/db](app/db/README.md).

#### Source Code
1. Clone the MBEE code by running: `git clone https://github.com/lmco/mbee.git`. 
2. Enter the directory with `cd mbee`.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and build by running `yarn install` or `npm install`.
2. Run MBEE by running `node mbee start`.

## Disclosure and Security Update Policy

**Lockheed Martin Internal**

If and when security-related updates are made to MBEE, the
[dl-SSC, MBEE-Admins](mailto:mbee-admin.dl-ssc@exch.ems.lmco.com) distribution
list will be notified first. If you are a system administrator of an MBEE
instance, please contact the [dl-SSC, MBEE-Software](mailto:mbee-software.dl-ssc@exch.ems.lmco.com)
distribution list to ensure you are added to the admins distribution list.

Once admins are notified and are able to update their instances, the
[dl-SSC, MBEE-Users](mailto:mbee-users.dl-ssc@exch.ems.lmco.com) distribution
list will be notified in the interest of transparency and program communication.

If your program has special needs that may require an alteration to this policy,
please contact our software team at the [dl-SSC, MBEE-Software](mailto:mbee-software.dl-ssc@exch.ems.lmco.com)
distribution list so that we may work together to identify an approach to meet
your program's needs.

Security updates will include a reasonable level of detail about the issue,
the severity and likelihood of impact, and the MBEE teams' assessment of the
risk introduced by the issue. Security updates will also specify which versions
are impacted and how to mitigate the issue.

For a list of MBEE security related updates as well as bug fixes and features,
refer to `CHANGELOG.md`.

> This only applies to non-LM users and the open source version of MBEE.

If and when security-related updates are made to MBEE, refer to `CHANGELOG.md`
for instructions on how to mitigate the issue.


## Known Gaps and Issues

#### MBEE Tests
The MBEE tests should not be run in production because the tests will create
an arbitrary admin user in the database.

It's important to ensure that all test users are deleted from the database.

#### Element Search UI
A known issue exists in the advanced element search in the UI. If the same field
is selected more than once for the advanced search, only the first value is
searched. For example, if searching by type `class` and by the type `block`,
only the `class` results would be found.

#### Windows Compatibility
At this point there are still some compatibility issues with windows. The
`package.json` includes post/pre install scripts that use linux specific
commands, as does the plugin loading. It is recommended you run MBEE on a linux
based device.

#### Internet Explorer
Internet Explorer does not currently have great support for React applications.
Because MBEE is written primarily in React, users who attempt to use MBEE on
Internet Explorer will not be able to use any of the UI features past the
login screen. Seeing that Mircosoft Edge is now the supported Windows browser,
it is not in the plans to officially support MBEE for Internet Explorer.

#### Plugin Loading
Due to the nature of how plugins are loaded, the API and UI are not accessible
until a plugin has been succesfully loaded. This can cause issues if plugins
hang while loading, and can result in the UI and API from being accessible.

## Security Related Configuration

### Plugins and Integrations
There are a few ways of writing applications that interact with MBEE. Client
applications and service-based integrations interact with MBEE via its API
and don't require much discussion here. However, understanding plugins is
critical to maintaining the security posture of an MBEE instance.

A plugin is a type of integration for MBEE that runs on the same server. In
fact, it is part of the same running process. It is a module or collection of
modules written in JavaScript as an Express application that is included by MBEE
and used under namespaced routes. These plugins offer the ability to extend the
functionality of MBEE. On one hand they allow for high-performance integrations
with direct access to the underlying MBEE modules and database connections. On
the other hand, they extend MBEE functionality in a monolithic approach
rather than a distributed microservice architecture that is created by API-based
integrations.

The most important thing to realize here is that a plugin, once-installed, is
part of MBEE. It is part of the same running process, has access to the running
configuration (which can include DB and/or LDAP credentials), and can execute
code on the server with the same privileges as the MBEE application.

This makes plugins critical to the running application's security posture.
It is the responsibility of the MBEE administrator to fully vet and understand
any plugins being installed on an MBEE instance.

### Ports

Below are the default ports necessary for running an MBEE instance and what those
ports are used for. The HTTP and HTTPS ports are adjustable in the configuration
file, and the database port can be adjusted on deployment and in the 
configuration file.

| Port   | Purpose           |
|:-------|:----------------- |
| 9080   | MBEE HTTP port    |
| 9443   | MBEE HTTPS port   |
| 27017  | Database          |


### Configuration JSON File

MBEE retrieves its configuration information from the JSON files in
`config/*.json`. Which JSON file is used depends on the value of the `NODE_ENV`
environment variable. MBEE looks for a file called `config/<NODE_ENV>.json`,
where `<NODE_ENV>` is the value stored in the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.
For example, if `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` MBEE will use the file
`config/production.json` for its configuration.

This configuration file contains security-related information such as database
credentials, authentication information, SSL certificate info, and more. This
configuration should not be checked into version control.

### Password Validation

Password validation was designed to be configurable through each authentication
module. When a user is created, the configured auth module is checked for an
exported validator function called `validatePassword()`. This function should
accept up to two parameters, the password (required) and the provider
(optional), and should return a boolean of whether the password is valid or not.

When creating a user, this function is ran and if the value *false* is returned,
the creation of that user is rejected. The default password requirements
provided in the local-strategy expect each password to contain at least 8
characters and at least one number, uppercase letter, lowercase letter and at
least one special character. If desired, one implementing this function can
allow for stricter requirements, but we do not suggest lessening the
requirements for security reasons.

If using an auth module that does not need to store passwords in the database
(such as LDAP), the `validatePassword()` function still needs to be provided and
exported, but only needs to return *true* for any case.

### HTTPS

To run MBEE with SSL enabled, you need a valid SSL certificate for the server.
Once you have this you can simply define the name of that certificate (which MBEE
expects to find in the `certs` directory of the project) in the `server.https`
section of the configuration JSON file. For example, consider the following
section of the configuration file:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "http": {
      "enabled": true,
      "port": 9080
    },
    "https": {
      "enabled": true,
      "port": 9443,
      "sslCertName": "dev.mbee.us.lmco.com"
    }
  }
}
```

HTTP and HTTPS can be enabled or disabled individually by setting their
respective `enabled` fields to either true or false. To run MBEE with only
HTTPS, simply disable HTTP by changing the `server.http.enabled` field to
`false`. Also, note that the ports used for HTTP and HTTPS can be configured.

### Server Secret Key

The `server` section of the config also contains a `secret` field which is used
as the secret key for symmetric encryption operations related to token-based
authentication. This secret key can be set manually, however, MBEE supports the
special case of a random key. When the `server.secret` field is set to `RANDOM`,
MBEE will use a randomly generated string as the secret key. This key is
generated on server startup and will change with each restart of the server.
This means that a restart of the server will invalidate session tokens.

### Authentication

MBEE operates on a concept of *modular authentication*. This means that one or
more authentication modules are defined in the MBEE code. These authentication
modules are located in the `app/auth` directory.

MBEE was built to be an open source product and was therefore designed with 
varying organizations in mind. To accommodate this, we implemented these 
authentication modules which allow each organization to write a few small 
functions to define their own authentication strategies that meet their 
organization's needs. As such, the module to be used is defined in the 
configuration JSON file. Consider the JSON configuration example below:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "strategy": "ldap-strategy",
    "ldap": {
        // LDAP information
    },
    "token": {
      "expires": 10,
      "units": "MINUTES"
    },
    "session": {
      "expires": 30,
      "units": "MINUTES"
    }
  }
}
```

The `auth.strategy` section tells MBEE which authentication module or *strategy*
to use. The `auth.ldap` section is required for the LDAP strategy and is used
to pass LDAP-specific information into MBEE.

Also important to note are the `auth.token` and `auth.session` configuration 
options. Both allow the definition of an expiration time, but there are 
differences between the two that should be explained.

A token is generated within MBEE. It stores basic information about the user
(such as username and token expiration time), which is encrypted using the server's 
secret key (see the section on [Server Secret Key](#server-secret-key) above). This
token is used to authenticate the user during session token authentication as
well as API token authentication. The `auth.token` section defines when this
token expires.

When interacting with MBEE via the UI, a user's token is stored in their session
object. The `auth.session` section defines when a session expires.

For API interactions with MBEE, only the `auth.token` expiration matters since
sessions are not used. However, for UI interaction with MBEE, both the token
and session definitions matter. Whichever expires first will cause the user's
authentication to expire.

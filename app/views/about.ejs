  <h2>About MBEE</h2>

  <p>The Model-Based Engineering Environment or MBEE is modeling collaboration tool
  that integrates system models with multidisciplinary engineering data to enable
  the system model to be a single-source of truth project data. It makes model
  data more accessible via a web-based user interface (UI) for ease of use across
  disciplines and skill sets within an organization. MBEE provides a web-based UI
  for team members to interact with system model data without needing to be a
  systems modeler themselves.</p>

  <p>The goal of MBEE is to better communicate data across engineering organizations
  by implementing the core goals of model-based systems engineering through
  software tools. MBEE decreases ambiguity by making a single-source of truth for
  data more achievable through its RESTful API, extensible plugins, and
  distributed services.</p>
